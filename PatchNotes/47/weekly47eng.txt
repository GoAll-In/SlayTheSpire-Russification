Greetings,

This week's focus was on prepping the final content for next week, visual updates, and bug fixes.

[h1]Final Content?! (BETA)[/h1]
It's coming to the beta branch on Monday! (October 29). We won't be giving out too much details in order to prevent spoilers. However, localization for this content will be available 1 or 2 days prior.

For information on the beta branch, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/1462971926900801868]click here![/url] Keep in mind that save files must be transferred manually if you switch to the beta branch. This is to prevent save file incompatibilities.
