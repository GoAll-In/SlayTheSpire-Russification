Hello everyone,

This week's patch brings further visual polish and improvements to controller support while we continue work on Steam Trading Cards and Workshop support. We also have some announcements!

[h1]Release Date[/h1]
Slay the Spire will be out of Early Access on January 23, 2019.
We'll reveal more on the future of Slay the Spire and Mega Crit Games on release.

[h1]Price Increase[/h1]
Anybody reading this probably owns the game. With the upcoming full release, there will be a price increase shortly after the upcoming Winter Sale so if you were planning on buying or gifting, it's a good time to do so!
