Hey again!

This week we worked on polishing and finishing up controller support, bringing in a new game mode: Endless, publishing the soundtrack, special seeds, and a handful of new relics.

[h1]Controller Support[/h1]
It's out of beta! Currently, support is limited to PS4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One controllers on the PC. To use a controller, just start the game with a controller plugged in.

[h1]Endless Mode (Beta)[/h1]
We're testing a game mode in the Beta branch: Endless! A lot of changes, bug fixes, and content are still planned so stay tuned!

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The official soundtrack is finally here! All of these tracks were created by Clark Aboud and the soundtrack contains all songs (plus a few extras) as 320kbps MP3s. If you want to know more, visit the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/877620/Slay_the_Spire__Soundtrack/]Soundtrack page![/url]

[h1]Special Seeds[/h1]
Special runs can be played by entering specific seeds! Ever wanted to play a random daily run? Play Slay the Spire in Draft mode? Do you just want to be one with Snecko? Now you can, and more! All of your dreams will come true, yada yada. A special UI and menu will probably be created if this turns out to be high demand.

We added special runs that you can play by entering specific seeds:
[list]
[*][b]RAND0M0DS[/b] or [b]DAILYM0DS[/b] will let you do new daily-style runs.
[*][b]DRAFT[/b] will activate the draft daily mod.
[*][b]MEGADRAFT[/b] will activate Diverse and Draft daily mods. Letting you draft from every characters' cards.
[*][b]FADEAWAY[/b] activates Night Terrors and Terminal. Can you beat the game before running out of HP?
[*][b]PRAISESNECK0[/b] Will replace your starting relic with Snecko Eye.
[*][b]Y0URET00SL0W[/b] Will activate the Time Dilation daily mod, giving all enemies Slow.
[*][b]STARTERDECK[/b] Will give you Busted Crown and Binary (Meaning enemies drop 0 cards. Can you win with the starter deck??)
[*][b]INCEPTI0N[/b] Start with Unceasing Top (it's a dream come true!)
[*][b]MYTRUEFORM[/b] You're a Demon! You're a Wraith! You Echo... echo echo. Start with one of each 'Form' card.
[*][b]1HITW0NDER[/b] Can you beat the game with 1 Max HP? 
[/list]
