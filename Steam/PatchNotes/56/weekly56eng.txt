Hello!

We're going into full release in just under a week so we have been hard at work finishing up Steam Trading cards, making some final balance adjustments, and ensuring that the game is as stable as possible.

[h1]Reddit AMA[/h1]
We're holding an AMA on Reddit on January 23 at 5pm (PST)!
For those not in the know, it means we'll be answering any questions you may have about the game or the team.
When it's up, we'll link it from our subreddit page:[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/]https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/[/url]

[h1]Price Increase[/h1]
The price of the game is increasing shortly before full release.
Last chance to get the game at our Early Access rate!

[h1]Incomplete Languages[/h1]
As many of you know, Slay the Spire was graciously translated by the community. Unfortunately, not all languages were fully translated or became outdated over time.

The following languages will become unavailable in the full release (but available in the beta branch):
[list]
[*]Greek
[*]Norwegian
[*]Thai
[*]Turkish
[*]Serbian (Cyrillic)
[*]Serbian (Latin)
[/list]

Did you know that Slay the Spire has been fully translated into 15 languages? Remarkable! For discussion, contribution, or just saying "Thanks!" to the translation efforts, come visit the localization community at our [url=http://discord.gg/slaythespire]Discord server.[/url] If you aren't playing Slay the Spire in English, it's all thanks to them!

[h1]Community Fan Art[/h1]
Oh nooo, where are we going to showcase art when the weekly updates stop?!
