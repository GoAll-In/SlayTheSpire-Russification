Hello!

This week we updated and added some enemies in Act 3, added various visual effects, made Neow changes, and worked on some performance improvements.

[h1]Act 3 Enemies[/h1]
Several changes were made in Act 3. Some stronger jaw worms and a wriggly monster have been introduced into the enemy pool.

Reptomancer has been buffed and designated as an elite monster.
The elite encounter featuring 2 orb walkers have been removed from the elite pool and are the new guards for an Act 3 event.

[h1]Visual Effects?![/h1]

Yep. Various cards and an enemy attack have received some special effects to make them feel better to use! Some animations were added and improved for The Silent and Defect as well. More animations and effects will be coming!

[h1]Neow Updates![/h1]
We created Neow with the intent to foster creative deckbuilding. However, many have felt that the game was considerably harder without a blessing from Neow and the threshold to receive her blessing was too high (especially in higher Ascensions).

To compensate, we've added a fixed set of choices for those who don't reach the Act 1 boss (Neow's Lament or HP bonus).

Additionally, two new Colorless Card-based blessings were added as these cards weren't seeing much play as they only appeared in shops and certain events.

[h1]Community Fan Art[/h1]
Such amazing art. I will try to get better, too! If you want to be featured, just mention [url=https://twitter.com/megacrit]@MegaCrit[/url] on Twitter!
