Hey everyone,

This week we spent time finishing and tweaking up some content while sorting through and incorporating beta art.

[h1]Final Content[/h1]
This will be available in the main branch next week. The additional music brought in with this content will also be added to the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/877620/Slay_the_Spire__Soundtrack/]Slay the Spire - Soundtrack[/url] next week, along with the special track used in the Mind Bloom event.

[h1]Beta Art[/h1]
A ton of submissions were received, thank you! The beta art submissions will be open for 1 more week as we identified some cards with missing portraits. For information on participation and what this entails, please see the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/1706195930369690868]previous weekly announcement.[/url]
