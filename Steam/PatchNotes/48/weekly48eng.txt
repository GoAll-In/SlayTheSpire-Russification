Happy Halloween (yesterday)!

This week we mainly worked on the final content which is now being tested in the beta branch! However, various fixes and improvements while working on this has carried over as well.

[h1]Final Content[/h1]
It's currently being tested in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/1462971926900801868]beta branch.[/url] It's on track to make it into the main branch this month (November)!

[h1]Beta Art![/h1]
When implementing cards throughout the development of Slay the Spire we drew and received a lot of placeholder art before our talented artists gave us finalized artwork. We've decided to share this artwork in the game but there's a problem: Not all of our cards have placeholder art.

We need your help to fill in the missing art or the beta art feature may not make it into the full release :(.

To help us resolve this crisis, please take a look at this [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oa5Ev8ivQiQlORiVeLhmUpwh3Ajnx-1tFgjJRzyDBLY/edit#gid=0]secret document which indicate what cards are missing beta art.[/url]

For contributions, we need a 500 x 380 PNG image that match a card template based on the card's type (templates below). Anything outside of the template will be removed.

[b]Submission Guidelines[/b]
Though we encourage any kind of art, please keep in mind that suggestions may be rejected for the following reasons:

[list]
[*]Suggestive or offensive content.
[*]Too little effort.
[*]Too much effort, you're making us look bad.
[*]Too many submissions from a single person (let other people have fun, too!)
[*]There's already art for that card, we can only have one slot. Sorry :(.
[*]The art is not related to the card at all.
[*]It's too late (noooo).
[/list]

Once your submission is ready, either post the image and tag us @Developers at our [url=https://discord.gg/SlayTheSpire]Discord server,[/url] or email us at support@megacrit.com. We cannot accept submissions through Twitter as the image will be severely compressed.
