Happy New Year!

This week's patch brings Steam Workshop support, bug fixes, and a few touch-ups here and there.

[h1]Steam Workshop[/h1]
Utilizing and keeping up-to-date with community-made mods are now easier as we're enabling Steam Workshop support today.

Have you wanted more cards, relics, characters? Many hardworking players have been modding Slay the Spire for quite a while and they can now be easily accessed through the workshop.

Browse the Workshop page, subscribe to some mods, and upon launching the game, choose the "Play with Mods" option.
